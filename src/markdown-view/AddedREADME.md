# React Native Markdown Renderer

"React Native Markdown Renderer" is very good markdown viewer.
Thanks to Mient-jan Stelling and other contributors.
But currently, I think that this module is not well supported.
And then, I have copied all source of "React Native Markdown Renderer" to 
this folder and debug for my project.

## Corrections

- Local image file loading problem (Android only)

- The bullet align problem (Android only)

- Old "child.type.displayName" problem
